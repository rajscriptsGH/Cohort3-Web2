#Why HTTP :: for the communication between systems around the world (client, server)

#HTTP::
\*HTTP is the protocol (set of rules) used for communication between web browsers and servers.

    *It defines how data (like web pages, images, etc.) is requested and delivered over the internet.

Example: when you open a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested content.

**Request** (HTTP Request)
A request is when a browser asks a server for some data, like a webpage or file.

**Response** (HTTP Response)
A response is when the server sends back the requested data to the browser.

# Domain Name:-

A domain name is the human-readable address of a website.
Example:
www.google.com,
www.youtube.com..

# IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):-

An IP address is the actual numeric address of a device (like a server or computer) on a network.

Example:
142.250.190.36 (an IP address for Google)

Real world analogy -
Domain name - Phone contact
IP - There real phone number
