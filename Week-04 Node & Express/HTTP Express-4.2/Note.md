# Why HTTP

for the communication between systems around the world (client, server)

# HTTP

**HTTP** is the protocol (set of rules) used for communication between web browsers and servers.

It defines how data (like web pages, images, etc.) is requested and delivered over the internet.

Example: when you open a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with the requested content.

# Request (**HTTP Request**)

A **request** is when a browser asks a server for some data, like a webpage or file.

# Response (**HTTP Response**)

A **response** is when the server sends back the requested data to the browser.

# Domain Name:-

A domain name is the human-readable address of a website.
Example:
www.google.com,
www.youtube.com..

# IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):-

An **IP address** is the actual numeric address of a device (like a server or computer) on a network.

Example:
142.250.190.36 (an IP address for Google)

Real world analogy -
Domain name - Phone contact
IP - There real phone number

# Ports

**Ports** are logical endpoints used by protocols to identify specific processes running on a computer or server.

They help direct network traffic to the correct application or service on a system.

# Methods

HTTP methods are used to specify the type of action that the client wants to perform on a resource on the server.

Common methods

1. **GET** - Retrieve data from a server
2. **POST** - Submit data to be processed by a server
3. **PUT** - Update or create a resource on the serve
4. **DELETE** - Remove a resource from the server

# Status Codes

Status codes are 3-digit numbers sent by a server to show the result of a request.
Common Categories:

1xx → Informational (Request received, continue processing)

2xx → Success (Request was successful)
Example: 200 OK

3xx → Redirection (Further action needed)
Example: 301 Moved Permanently

4xx → Client Error (Problem with the request)
Example: 404 Not Found

5xx → Server Error (Problem on server side)
Example: 500 Internal Server Error
