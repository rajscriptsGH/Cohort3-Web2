## What is TypeScript?

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors during development instead of in the browser.

If you know JavaScript, TypeScript builds on top of it makes your code safer and more readable.

# Step 1: Set Up TypeScript

- 🛠 Install Node.js (if not installed)
- Go to https://nodejs.org/ and download LTS version.

- 📦 Install TypeScript globally
- Open your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

- Check if it's installed:

```bash
tsc -v
```

# Step 2: Your First TypeScript File

- Create a folder and file

```bash
mkdir folder_name
cd folder_name
touch index.ts
```

- Write this in index.ts

```ts
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
console.log(message);
```

- Now compile it:

```bash
tsc -b
or
npx tsc -b
```

- This creates an index.js file.

- Run it:

```bash
node index.js
```

- You’ll see:

`Hello, TypeScript!`

# Step 3: Basic Types

### Type Example

```
- string let name: string = "Raj"
- number let age: number = 21
- boolean let isCool: boolean = true
- any let data: any = "anything"
- undefined let x: undefined = undefined
```

## Example:

```ts
let myName: string = "Raj";
let age: number = 21;
let isStudent: boolean = true;
```

- Note: Try changing myName = 12 and see how TypeScript throws an error.

# Step 4: Functions with Types

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Razz")); // OK
console.log(greet(5)); // ❌ Error!
```

# Step 5: Objects

```ts
let person: { name: string; age: number } = {
  name: "Raj",
  age: 22,
};
```
