## Zustand

- Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React applications. It's beginner-friendly and much simpler than Redux, making it perfect if you're just starting out but want something powerful.

- “Zustand” is a German word meaning “state.”
  It helps you manage and share state (data) between components in React without much boilerplate code.

## Why Choose Zustand Over Others?

- Super fast and minimal

- Supports both global and local state

- No Provider wrapper needed

- Great for testing and debugging

- Works with server-side rendering (Next.js)
