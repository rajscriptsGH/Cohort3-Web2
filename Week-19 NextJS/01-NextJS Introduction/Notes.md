# nextJS

## Step 4 - Next.js offerings

Next.js provides you the following upsides over React

- Server side rendering - Get’s rid of SEO problems
- API routes - Single codebase with frontend and backend
- File based routing (no need for react-router-dom)
- Bundle size optimisations, Static site generation
- Maintained by the Vercel team

## Downsides

- Can’t be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does server side rendering and hence is expensive
- Very opinionated, very hard to move out of it
